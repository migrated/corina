<p>The <code>edu.cornell.dendro.corina.cross</code> package contains
algorithms for crossdating samples, and also higher-level data
structures which help for crossing many samples.</p>



<h2>How to use in an application</h2>

<p>Sequence provides the client interface to crossdating.  Construct a
Sequence (any of its subclasses: 1xN, NxN, 1x1, or Nx1).  You can step
through the crosses with nextCross() and prevCross(), and get the
current cross with getCross().  (Unfortunately, Java Enumerations are
forward-only.)</p>

<p>The Cross you get will only be references: you must still run() it.
A Cross contains the scores in <code>data</code>, as a
<code>double[]</code>.  Significant scores are stored in the
<code>ArrayList</code> <code>highScores</code>, as indexes into the
data array.  (The method <code>yearOfIndex()</code> might help.)

<p>Grids and Tables are completely different, because they're not
typically interactive, but they are constructed roughly the same as
NxN and 1xN Sequences, respectively.</p>



<h2>How to add a new crossdating algorithm</h2>

<p>Look at <code>Cross.java</code>; that's the class you need to
extend.  The only two methods you need to define are
<code>getMinimumSignificant()</code>, which returns the minimum
significant crossdate score for that algorithm, and
<code>compute(int,int)</code>, which computes the score at those
particular offsets.  Your constructor should accept two Sample
objects, and pass them to super().</p>

<p>You may need to create a <code>preamble()</code> method, too; this
does any needed operations with the data that must be done before
individual scores are calculated.  For example, the T-Score preamble
creates a normalized copy of the data.</p>

<p>A <code>CrossSet</code> is a full set of crossdates for a given
pair (fixed and moving) of samples.  If you want your crossdate to be
in general use, add it to <code>CrossSet()</code>.</p>
