Image-recognition to find tree rings on a scanned section by image
analysis.

<p>Parts of corina.eyes:</p>
<ul>

  <li>an image loader (JPEG, TIFF?)

  <li>an interactive panel, showing the image, and letting me draw
  (with the mouse) where on the sample I wish to measure

  <li>(optionally, something that lets Corina guess intelligently for
  itself where the pith and bark are and draw a good first
  approximation itself)

  <li>measure: given an image, and starting and ending points, give me
  a list of [length brightness] tuples; from that, compute ring widths

  <li>a density panel, to show me brightness-versus-distance so I can
  verify the rings myself; using Schweingruber's method, let me pick
  (by dragging) the threshold values myself (optionally, differing
  over time)

</ul>
<p>(These aren't independent, or even all written yet.)</p>
