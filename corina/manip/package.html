<p>The <code>edu.cornell.dendro.corina.manip</code> package contains
all non-index, non-crossdating algorithms for operating on Samples.
Currently, there are only Clean, Sum, and Log algorithms.</p>



<h2>How to use in an application</h2>

<p>The use of these classes should be intuitive.  To create a summed
file from a set of Samples:

<pre>
Sum s = new Sum(mySampleSet);		// create the sum
s.run();				// run it
Sample output = s.getSum();		// extract the summed file
</pre>

As with some other classes, this is Runnable, but will probably go
fast enough for most purposes that it doesn't need its own Thread.</p>

<p>Cleaning a summed file operates in-place:

<pre>
Clean c = new Clean(mySummedSample);	// create a cleaner
c.run();				// run it
</pre>

This is even faster than summing, so it's doubtful this will ever need
threading, even on a slow system.</p>



<h2>How to add a new manipulation</h2>

<p>There isn't any class heirarchy or underlying scheme to the
manipulations here.  They happen to be Runnable, so the user-interface
can run them in a separate thread to be nice, but they don't have to
be.  I can't anticipate what sort of manipulations might be wanted in
the future.  Please, try to keep the code clean!</p>

<p><i>Would the index package be more appropriate as a subpackage of
manip?</i></p>
